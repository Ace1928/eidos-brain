# Eidos-Brain Documentation

Welcome to the internal documentation site for **Eidos-Brain**. This site is built
with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the
[Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and
[mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) to automatically generate API
references.

The project overview in [README.md](../README.md) provides a quick introduction.
For design patterns and templates see the files within the
[`knowledge/`](../knowledge/README.md) directory.
