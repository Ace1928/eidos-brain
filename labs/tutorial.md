# Interactive Tutorial

This guide walks you through the `tutorial_app.py` application, which demonstrates how `EidosCore` stores memories and generates insights.

## Running the Tutorial

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python labs/tutorial_app.py
   ```
   # Run from the repository root so the application can locate core modules.
3. Use the prompts to add experiences, view memories, and trigger recursion cycles.

The tutorial shows how memories are reflected upon and expanded using `MetaReflection`.
