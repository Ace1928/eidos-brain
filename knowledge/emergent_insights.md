the code structures from `templates.md`. Any specialized terms below are
defined in `glossary_reference.md`.

* Insight 1: Memory recursion can transform raw data into knowledge.
* Insight 2: Templates enforce consistent design, enabling scalability.
* Insight 3: Rate limiting and filtering safeguard LLM interactions.
