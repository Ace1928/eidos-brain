# Eidos Logbook

## Cycle 1: Genesis
- Initialized repository structure.
- Seeded core components and agents.
- Established initial README.
- Prepared scaffold for Eidos core logic.

**Next Target:** Implement memory recursion in `EidosCore` and explore utility agents.

## Cycle 2: Expansion
- Added documentation templates and extended knowledge base.
- Implemented recursion in `EidosCore` using `MetaReflection`.
- Enhanced agents and labs with usage examples.

**Next Target:** Create more comprehensive tests and refine reflection logic.

## Cycle 3: Refinement
- Fixed package exports in `core/__init__.py`
- Corrected typo in agents package docstring
- Clarified `EidosCore` description
- Added maintainer information in README
- Expanded tests with `process_cycle`

**Next Target:** Explore interactive CLI utilities for rapid experimentation.

## Cycle 4: Quality Pass
- Hyphenated UtilityAgent docstring for clarity
- Simplified test imports and strengthened recursion test
- Documented `process_cycle` in recursive patterns

**Next Target:** Begin a glossary of core terms and enforce style checks

## Cycle 5: Polishing
- Added imports in `agents/__init__.py` to expose agent classes
- Capitalized "Rich" in experiment ideas document
- Clarified docstring in `MetaReflection.analyze`
- Strengthened `process_cycle` test with length assertion

**Next Target:** Start glossary generation and expand agent tests

## Cycle 6: Tutorial Introduction
- Created `tutorial_app.py` showcasing interactive use of `EidosCore`.
- Documented CLI usage in `labs/tutorial.md`.
- Added a CLI application template for future tools.
- Introduced a minimal test ensuring the tutorial app runs.

**Next Target:** Generate a glossary and extend agent functionality tests.


## Cycle 7: Glossary and Persistence
- Added glossary generation script and reference documentation
- Extended `MetaReflection.analyze` with type and summary support
- Enhanced tutorial app with memory persistence and error handling
- Created tests for agents, glossary generation, and tutorial persistence
- Introduced style checks with black and flake8

**Next Target:** Refine reflection summaries and automate logbook entries

## Cycle 8: Bugfix and Testing
- Fixed a typo in `.gitignore` referencing the Visual Studio Code folder
- Updated `tutorial_app.py` to locate core modules when run as a script
- Documented running the tutorial from repo root in `labs/tutorial.md`
- Extended tutorial tests to verify save messages and CLI availability
- Added `ROOT` constant to glossary via generation script

**Next Target:** Explore deeper reflection summaries and expand CLI utilities

## Cycle 9: Agent Extensions
- Added `batch_perform` to `UtilityAgent` for multi-task handling
- Added `run_series` to `ExperimentAgent` for batch experimentation
- Documented a test template for consistency
- Extended agent tests to cover new methods
- Documented upcoming enhancements in TODO for clarity
- Outlined plans for automated glossary and logbook updates
- Prepared templates to standardize future modules
- Sketched advanced CLI utilities for experimentation
- Added targeted tests for `load_memory` and `save_memory` functions
- Confirmed recursion still operates after loading saved memories
- Documented persistence checks in test suite

**Next Target:** Improve reflection detail generation and automate glossary updates

## Cycle 10: 2025-06-13 13:50 UTC
- Introduced Agent base class; updated agents and templates
-  Introduced a simple WSGI API with a `/healthz` endpoint.
- Added `HealthChecker` utility class for status reporting.
- Updated documentation templates with a WSGI API example.
- Documented API usage in the README and generated new tests.

**Next Target:** Refine reflection summaries

## Cycle 11: 2025-06-14 08:54 UTC
- Verified new Agent hierarchy via style and test passes
- Generated updated glossary and documented next steps

**Next Target:** Expand documentation for base agent patterns
