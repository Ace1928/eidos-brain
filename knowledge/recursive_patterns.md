# Recursive Patterns

## Memory Recursion Pattern
1. Collect experiences.
2. Reflect on stored memories.
3. Generate insights via meta-reflection.
4. Append insights as new memories for future cycles.

### Combined Cycle Pattern
Use `process_cycle` to store an experience and immediately recurse,
appending reflective insights in a single step.
