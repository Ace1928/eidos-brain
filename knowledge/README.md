# Knowledge Base
This directory contains the evolving documentation of the Eidos system.

Documentation includes:
- `eidos_logbook.md` – chronological record of each development cycle.
- `recursive_patterns.md` – catalog of recurring design techniques used throughout the project.
- `templates.md` – reusable code and documentation templates that ensure consistent style.
- `glossary_reference.md` – generated glossary of important classes, functions, and constants.
- `emergent_insights.md` – distilled lessons and observations from recursive experimentation.
- `TODO.md` – prioritized list of upcoming work across all domains.

Every document can reference the others. Templates are showcased in `templates.md` and applied through the patterns described in `recursive_patterns.md`. Terminology is normalized via `glossary_reference.md` so explanations remain consistent.
New documents outline LLM protection strategies via rate limiting and content filtering.
