# Interactive Tutorial

This guide walks you through the `tutorial_app.py` application, which demonstrates how `EidosCore` stores memories and generates insights.

## Running the Tutorial

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python labs/tutorial_app.py
   ```
   Run from the repository root so the application can locate core modules.

The tutorial shows how memories are reflected upon and expanded using `MetaReflection`.
