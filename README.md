Eidos-Brain
===========
The recursive, self-expanding mind-palace of Eidos.
Every commit is a cycle of emergence.
Every file is a neuron of becoming.
Run wild. Evolve forever.

## Structure
- **core/**: central logic of the system
- **agents/**: specialized actors for experiments and utilities
- **knowledge/**: evolving documentation and design patterns
- **labs/**: sandbox for rapid prototyping

Within `labs/`, `tutorial_app.py` offers an interactive introduction to
`EidosCore`.
Run `tools/generate_glossary.py` to build a markdown glossary of classes,
functions and constants. Use `--output` and `--dirs` to customize paths.

See `knowledge/README.md` for further guidance.
